[Warning] `AlertDialogContent` requires a description for the component to be accessible for screen reader users. (@radix-ui_react-alert-dialog.js, line 273)

You can add a description to the `AlertDialogContent` by passing a `AlertDialogDescription` component as a child, which also benefits sighted users by adding visible context to the dialog.

Alternatively, you can use your own component as a description by assigning it an `id` and passing the same value to the `aria-describedby` prop in `AlertDialogContent`. If the description is confusing or duplicative for sighted users, you can use the `@radix-ui/react-visually-hidden` primitive as a wrapper around your description component.

For more information, see https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/alert-dialog
